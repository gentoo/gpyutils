gpyutils (obsolete tools)
=========================

These tools are mostly obsolete nowadays. They used to be helpful during
the python.eclass -> python-r1 migration but nowadays they pretty much
provide 'all is python-r1' output in a very complex way.


gpy-counts
----------

gpy-counts provides a few statistical numbers regarding conversion
of scripts to python-r1 eclasses. For each package in the repository,
it checks whether and which eclasses are used in the ebuilds, and which
of the ebuilds went stable.

For each of the four kinds of Python packages (the four -r1 eclasses),
it provides three numbers:

- the number of packages which are fully converted, that is there is
  at least a single -r1 ebuild and either it is stable or the package
  has no stable keywords at all,

- the number of packages which were converted disregarding keywords,
  that is there is at least a single -r1 ebuild,

- the total number of Python packages.

Those numbers are output as CSS which -- when put in html/ -- gives
shiny progress bars in ``html/conversion.xhtml``.

The scan is done per-repository.


gpy-depcands
------------

gpy-depcands searches the tree for urgent -r1 conversion candidates.
It checks the dependencies of already-converted packages and recursively
lists their Python dependencies that haven't been converted to the new
eclass yet.

The output consists of the -r1 package followed by an indented tree
of dependencies needing to be converted.

The scan can be done per-repository or per-package, if package atoms
are passed on the command-line. In the latter case, every listed package
is assumed to be -r1, therefore making it possible to use the script to
scan dependencies of a package you're planning to convert.
